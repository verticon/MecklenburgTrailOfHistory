// This protocol is used by the Firebase.Observer<Data> class. The data type being observered
// might need to perform additional initializations before the observer is notified. For example:
// network fetches that were not feasable to be performed by the initializer might be needed.
// Firebase.Observer<Data> makes the data instance responsible for calling the observer. In this
// way the data type being observed as an oppurtunity to perform those additional initialization
// step if needed
